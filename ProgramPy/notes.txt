Requirements
    1. be called mypython.py
    2. Create 3 files in same dir as script, each w/ diff name
        files remain after script executes
        each file contains 10 random lowercase characters, no spaces
        final (11th) character of each file MUST be newline
            running wc (wordcount bash utility) against it must return 11
    3. When executed, output sent to stdout should first print contents of 3
        files it is creating in exactly format below:

            $ python mypython.py
            asdfhjkler
            wersdaiuas
            asdfasderr
            8
            10
            80

    4. After file contents of all three files have been printed, print two
        random integeres on separate line (range from 1 to 42, inclusive)
    5. On last (6th) line, print out product of two numbers

    ***Do NOT have to parse and read data back in from files from step 2 to
       complete step 3 - just dump contents already generated onto screen

    look into sys.stdout.write() for outputting text to control newlines

    Graders check for above requirements

    No help from instructors or TA
